# Cowg - Controller for Wireguard

_Pronounced cog_

Cowg is a TUI to manage Wireguard over SSH.

## Usage

Run the application on a server that has Wireguard installed:

```
cowg ssh
```

This starts the SSH server on port 22022, and a HTTP server on port 22080.

More details on the usage coming soon!
